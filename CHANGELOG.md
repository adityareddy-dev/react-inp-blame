# Changelog

The format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the versions are
[semantic](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). `schemaVersion` on a report is versioned separately:
it changes when a field is removed or changes meaning, which a minor release may do while it is 0.x.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **A hydration verdict.** A click that lands on server-rendered HTML React has not hydrated yet is
  named as that instead of going unexplained: `report.hydration` says whether React hydrated it inside
  the click (`kind: 'waited'`, with the boundary and the time) or it was still waiting and no React
  handler ran (`kind: 'not-hydrated'`). `explanation.blame.kind` gains `'hydration'`, a `Phase` may
  carry `parts` so the hydrating time shows inside the working time without becoming a fourth phase,
  and a commit carries `hydratedTarget`, the boundary it hydrated around the input's target. Reports
  stay at `schemaVersion: 1`: the fields are new, and the phases add up as they did. React 18 and 19
  only, and `apps/next-demo` has a streamed Suspense boundary that proves it under `next dev`, Turbopack
  and webpack.

  Two things to check when you take this. A `switch` over `explanation.blame.kind` that TypeScript
  checks for exhaustiveness now has a case missing, `'hydration'`. And a report object your own code
  builds, in a test fixture or a fake, needs the three new fields: `hydration` on the report,
  `hydratedTarget` on a commit and `dehydrated` on an input record. A report stored before this release
  and read back has them `undefined`; the library treats that as `null` throughout.
- `react-inp-blame/web-vitals`: `generateTarget` puts a React component path where web-vitals writes a
  CSS selector, and `attributeINP(metric)` adds this library's report for the interaction to an INP
  metric as `attribution.react`. It imports nothing from web-vitals, `generateTarget` needs no
  `install()`, and neither throws on a metric it cannot read.
- A hosted demo, built from `apps/demo` and deployed to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.
- Issue forms for a wrong or missing blame and for a setup problem, and this changelog.

### Fixed

- `withInpBlame` threw nothing when the options were passed as its first argument, where the Next.js
  config goes. Next.js dropped them with "Unrecognized key(s) in object", nothing installed, and the
  library looked broken. It now refuses that call and quotes the two-argument form with the caller's
  own values.
- `withInpBlame` and `inpBlame` ignored an option they do not have, so `{ overlay: true }` written a
  level too high showed nothing and said nothing. Both now refuse an unknown key, list the ones they
  take, and, when the key is an `install()` option, say it belongs under `runtime`.
- A commit that rendered no component at all, which is what React's retry of a boundary it still cannot
  hydrate leaves behind, was described as "re-rendering 0 components inside the app". It now says React
  committed without rendering a component.
- A label read from an element's text stopped at the first `<!-- -->` React's server renderer leaves
  between two adjacent text children, so a hydrated `Slow click ({count})` was labelled
  `Slow click (`. Those comments are separators inside one run of text and are now skipped, up to a
  fixed number of siblings.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- A report with no target read "Typing in" with nothing after it. It now reads "Typing" or "Click".

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-17

First release.

### Added

- `install()` joins the browser's Event Timing entries and Long Animation Frames to React's fiber
  tree, through the hook React keeps for developer tools, and publishes a frozen `InteractionReport`
  for each slow interaction: the blame with its confidence, the phases, the components that rendered
  before and after the paint, and a plain-language verdict. `onInteraction(fn)` hears them.
- An INP estimate for the navigation the page is on, `inp()`, written from the same entries web-vitals
  reads and checked against web-vitals 6.2.2 over more than 50 interactions in a browser.
- An on-page badge and panel, `overlay`, drawn as plain DOM in a shadow root and loaded only when
  shown, and a track per report in Chrome's Performance panel.
- `withInpBlame` for Next.js 16.3 and later: the runtime on `instrumentationClientInject`, so it
  installs before hydration, and a `displayName` loader under Turbopack and webpack. `inpBlame` for
  Vite does the same two things, and `react-inp-blame/auto` covers any other bundler.
- React 17, 18 and 19, and a fail-closed check on every React internal the library reads.
