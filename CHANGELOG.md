# Changelog

The format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the versions are
[semantic](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). `schemaVersion` on a report is versioned separately:
it changes when a field is removed or changes meaning, which a minor release may do while it is 0.x.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `react-inp-blame/web-vitals`: `generateTarget` puts a React component path where web-vitals writes a
  CSS selector, and `attributeINP(metric)` adds this library's report for the interaction to an INP
  metric as `attribution.react`. It imports nothing from web-vitals, `generateTarget` needs no
  `install()`, and neither throws on a metric it cannot read.
- A hosted demo, built from `apps/demo` and deployed to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.
- Issue forms for a wrong or missing blame and for a setup problem, and this changelog.

### Fixed

- `withInpBlame` threw nothing when the options were passed as its first argument, where the Next.js
  config goes. Next.js dropped them with "Unrecognized key(s) in object", nothing installed, and the
  library looked broken. It now refuses that call and names the two-argument form.
- A label read from an element's text stopped at the first empty comment React's server renderer
  leaves between two adjacent text children, so a hydrated `Slow click ({count})` was labelled
  `Slow click (`. Those comments are separators inside one run of text and are now skipped.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- A report with no target read "Typing in" with nothing after it. It now reads "Typing" or "Click".

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-17

First release.

### Added

- `install()` joins the browser's Event Timing entries and Long Animation Frames to React's fiber
  tree, through the hook React keeps for developer tools, and publishes a frozen `InteractionReport`
  for each slow interaction: the blame with its confidence, the phases, the components that rendered
  before and after the paint, and a plain-language verdict. `onInteraction(fn)` hears them.
- An INP estimate for the navigation the page is on, `inp()`, written from the same entries web-vitals
  reads and checked against web-vitals 6.2.2 over more than 50 interactions in a browser.
- An on-page badge and panel, `overlay`, drawn as plain DOM in a shadow root and loaded only when
  shown, and a track per report in Chrome's Performance panel.
- `withInpBlame` for Next.js 16.3 and later: the runtime on `instrumentationClientInject`, so it
  installs before hydration, and a `displayName` loader under Turbopack and webpack. `inpBlame` for
  Vite does the same two things, and `react-inp-blame/auto` covers any other bundler.
- React 17, 18 and 19, and a fail-closed check on every React internal the library reads.
